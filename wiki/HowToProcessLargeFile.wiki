= Introduction =

When reading/writing excel file with POI it consumes a lot of memory for parsing content, making a memory requirement ~3Gb for processing of excel file of size ~20Mb. Provided details below on how to make use of streaming API provided by POI to process large files.

= Details =

There are streaming API which enables streaming for reading and streaming for writing.

[http://code.google.com/p/sqlsheet sqlsheet] starting from [http://sqlsheet.googlecode.com/svn/maven2/com/google/code/sqlsheet/ version 6.1] supports both modes. To enable streaming you need to pass specific preference in JDBC url:

=== Read streaming ===
  * Parameter to enable read streaming: *readStreaming*
{{{
url="jdbc:xls:file:test.xls?readStreaming=true"
}}}
  * When read streaming enabled - you cannot modify excel file, eow connection is read-only
  * Works for both XLS and XSLX formats

=== Write streaming ===
  * Parameter to enable write streaming: *writeStreaming*
{{{
url="jdbc:xls:file:test.xlsx?writeStreaming=true"
}}}
  * When write streaming enabled - you cannot query existing excel file, eow connection is write-only
  * You can create tables (sheets) in file using JDBC and write data, each 1k of rows excel file will be flushed to disk and memory cleaned
  * Write streaming works only for XSLX formats
  * You can provide existing file, but only as template which needs to be filled, if you will provide large existing file - you will get memory issue
